# Godot-Coroutine

Simple implementation of Unity-like coroutines

IMPORTANT: This is not the best implementation for coroutines. Don't use it if you're looking to make a professional game. I will implement threads when I need it for my projects, but not yet. It runs in the main thread. There are better ways to achieve this. Only use this if you intend to have something easy to use that gets the job done, but not necessarily in the best way. My main focus with this is to have simplicity and a legible code.

I'm not making any tests for this because I'm tired of doing it at my day job. Game dev is pure fun. No tests. Sorry.
At least, this is free.

:D
